# Hello

I'm Mark a graduating data scientist. Take a look at my projects while I figure out the rest...
_If you're in a hurry this should tell everything [numpy, pandas, pytorch, matplotlib, networkx].. sometimes some embedded development in C-variant_

## Stuff I've partly written

[My bachelor thesis project about conditional probabilities](https://github.com/vioSpark/weather-data-analyzer-public)

[A research project where we calculated the difference of the color between the samples based on spectral performance](https://github.com/vioSpark/color_sample_measurements)

[A few cool stuff I've done under my bachelors](https://github.com/vioSpark/BME-cool-part)

[A huge C++ project we still haven't cleaned up after the competition](https://github.com/Defragged-Zebra/Ericsson2020)
[And the next project with the same team, this time in python](https://github.com/Defragged-Zebra/Bosch2020)

[When I nerded out, and made a mathematical model following a random idea](https://github.com/vioSpark/lens-system-optimizer) (to be fair I've solved a lot of my bachelor homeworks with notebooks like this)

## Stuff when coding wasn't the main focus

[When we analyzed some dangerously-high-level math concepts to understand how to improve existing CNNs](https://towardsdatascience.com/sesn-cec766026179)

[Or this time when we translated a vision into a technological roadmap](https://lukacs-mark.medium.com/here-comes-the-police-36e050a1224e)
